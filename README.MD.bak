## Precipitation's control over streamflow across the conterminous United States

This is a repository fot the WRR article titled [Strength and memory of precipitation's control over streamflow 
across the conterminous United States.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021WR030186)

## Dataset
The CAMELS dataset can be obtained from: https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels 
### Folders and descriptions:
	1. CAMELS - contains the information theoretic metrics based on the CAMELS dataset.
	2. HBV - contains the dataset for the two watersheds (French Broad and Guadalupe).
	3. Code - contains the main script that computes the information theoretic metrics.

The information theoretic metrics include:

1. Entropies - $ H(X) $ and $ H(Y) $
2. Mutual information - $I(Y_{t};X_{t-lag})$
3. Transfer entropy - $I(Y_{t};X_{t-lag}|Y_{t-1})$
4. Correlation coeficients - $\r (Y_{t},X_{t-lag})$
5. Total information based on X - $I(Y_{t}; X_{t},X_{t-1})$
6. Total information based on Y - $I(Y_{t}; X_{t},Y_{t-1})$
